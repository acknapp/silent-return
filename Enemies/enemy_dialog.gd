#Idle:
#All quiet here.
#Something feels off.
#Peaceful, for now at least.
#Intruders will not get past me.
#That rice better come soon.
#Last night's food felt different.
#It better not rain like last time.
#The children could be walking by now.
#They will pay for stealing from us.
#I wonder when the bathhouse will be finished.
#
#Player meet (disguised):
#Keep walking, recruit
#New face, try to keep up with the rest.
#New recruit, try not to meet your ancestors too early.
#Watch yourself warrior, everyone's on edge.
#Get to your duties and don't bother anyone.
#Some advice, warrior. The enemy can strike at any time.
#New recruit, huh? Survive a few battles, then we can talk.
#Never seen your face before, you must be new.
#Get to your post, new guy.
#Get to your post, recruit.
#You smell like you haven't bathed in weeks. Disgraceful.
#
#Player Suspicious
#What are you doing here for?
#What do you think you're doing?
#Where do you think you're going?
#Who are you supposed to be?
#Hmmmm
#Something's off about you.
#What is this...?
#Slacking is a punishable offence.
#
#Suspicioun lost
#Must be nothing
#Got better things to do
#Could just be me.
#Hope it was nothing.
#I've got nothing.
#Must have been my imagination.
#
#Player spotted (Undisguised or disguise broken)
#Intruder!
#Intruder! Die!
#Intruder! Kill him!
#Perish, intruder!
#Tresspasser!
#Tresspasser! Die!
#Tresspasser! Kill him!
#Perish, tresspasser!
#Wrong place, fool!
#Begone, peasant!
#Stupid wanderer!
#Begone outsider!
#You're not supposed to be here!
#Taste my steel
#
#Player spotted (wrong disguise)
#Enemy scout! Sound the alarm!
#Die, wretch!
#Foolish idiot!
#We have a breach!
#The enemy is here!
#Sound the Alarm!
#The enemy reveals their hand!
#The foe is here!
#The enemy is at our door!
#
#Player Lost
#He was here, I swear it.
#Dissappeared, like a coward.
#Gone, typical.
#Could be anywhere now.
#If I see them again, they're dead.
#Great, heightened paranoia for weeks.
#Could just be my imagination.
